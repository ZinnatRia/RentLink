  <p>Our user base consists of proprietors looking to rent their properties and potential tenants looking for rent.These customers can be further classified into regular and non-technical users.</p><br>
  <p>To cater to the non-technical demographics of the market, we provide quick and easy option to use our applications via voice commands.</p>`,
