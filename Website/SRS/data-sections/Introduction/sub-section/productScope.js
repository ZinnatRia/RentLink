  content: `<p>The software aims to streamline the rental process by providing advanced tools like artificial intelligence (speech recognition), voice commands, augmented reality, an intelligent in-app communication system, and other nifty features to make enlisting and discovery protocols quick and convenient.</p>
    <br>
  <p>Proprietors can attach photos to their posts by uploading them or using the camera to take pictures. They can also set reminders, which will send an email with a link that will take them to the camera automatically and attach photos to that post.p>
    <br>
  <p>The software will allow tenants to narrow their options based on preferences, save their preferences, and get notified once rental units catering to their needs get enlisted. It will provide proprietors with relevant data on people viewing their posts, which will help them make sense of the market dynamics and revise their offers accordingly.</p>
    <br>
  <p>An in-app communication space between proprietors and tenants will allow communication via texts and voice messages. There will be an option to transcribe voice messages to text. The mobile application will enable users to call the other party by putting their numbers in the call dialer.</p>
    <br>
  <p>On top of traditional protocols for enlisting and discovery, e.g., typing, the software will use speech recognition to allow voice commands. Furthermore, the mobile application will provide tenants with guided tours of potential rental units using Augmented Reality.</p>
